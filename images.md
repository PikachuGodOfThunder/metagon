These commands are located in the Images category of the startup menu.

## Animal Images
I don't think I need to explain it.

* Command Entry: `/cat` `/snake` `/bunny` `/dog`

## Anime actions
Kiss/Pat/Hug yourself or your buddy. Or give them a smug.

* Command Entry: `/kiss` `/pat` `/hug` `/smug`

## Illustrations
### DeviantArt
Searches images from [DeviantArt](http://deviantart.com).

* Command Entry: `/deviantart <Query>`

### Pixiv
Searches images from [pixiv](http://pixiv.net).

* Command Entry: `/pixiv <Query>`

#### Query

* `Query`: Include this tag.
* `-Query`: Exclude this tag.
* ` ` separates tags when multiple tags are present.

For users who chose not to display NSFW content, `-R-18 -R-18G` is automatically enabled at the end of your query. However, this does ONLY filter illustrations that are tagged either `R-18` or `R-18G` (which are required tags for such illustrations).

Japanese tags are suggested, as the majority of pixiv users are Japanese-speaking.
