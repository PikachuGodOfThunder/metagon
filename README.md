## Somehow-Official???
I am an official co-developer of Metagon on Discord, but however the owner did not actually approve this. (He didn't disagree either.)

## How to run it?
1. Node.js v7.0.0 or higher
2. Clone it, then terminal: `npm install`
3. Go to start.js
4. Put bot token on Line 8
5. (Optional) Put your ID on Line 10. Find out your ID by asking [@userinfobot](https://telegram.me/userinfobot) `/start`.
6. Terminal: `npm start`
