## Issue
### Don't post issues:
* Relating to the uptime (After a crash, the bot should restart within 20 minutes if I'm not online, or 5 minutes if I'm online. Uptime is monitored.)
* Relating to the content (We are not responsible for the content provided by various APIs.)
  * Unless you're on Kik, where NSFW content is prohibited. As such, you should report to us if the bot posted something questionable **on Kik**.
* Without the template

## Pull Request
