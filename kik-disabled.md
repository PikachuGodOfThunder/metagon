# Regarding "Function Unavailable" on Kik
To comply with rule 3.2, 3.3 and 5.1 of Kik's [Developer Guidelines](https://dev.kik.com/#/docs/guidelines), the following functions are affected **on Kik only**.

You can, still, use these functions normally by [adding Metagon on another platform](https://metagon.cf/#invite-me). However, you are not allowed to send questionable content back to Kik, or *you* will be the person at fault.

We're sorry for the inconvenience. Feel free to [contact us](http://kik.me/austinhuang0131) if you have any questions.

## Permanently disabled
All in Image category.

* Flickr: Yahoo's SafeSearch filter definitely doesn't work in the way it should.
* IbSearch: Each boorus' `rating:s` works differently. Some boorus rate NSFW pictures SFW.
* Imgur: Literally un-moderatable.
* Pixiv: English-speaking illustrators rarely apply `R-18`/`R-18G` on their NSFW work.

## Partially disabled
Both in Fun category.

* You can't browse the NSFW section on 9gag.
* You can't get Explicit jokes on Chuck Norris.
